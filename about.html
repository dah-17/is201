                        <p>I was born in Oregen in 2003. A few years later, around the time that I was 4 years old, my family moved to Idaho and I have lived there ever since. I grew up spending all my time outdoors in the mountians and forests of Idaho.</p>
                        <p>This blessed me with a love of the outdoors. Hiking and biking are two of my favorite pastimes. As I got older I realized that I wantend to go to college and knew that I should find something to study that I would be passionate about.</p>
                        <p>I have always found math to come easier to me, but the idea of a math major sounded horrible to me. I soon discovered that I was fascinated by business finacials and how companies were ran. I began to investigage career paths and found that accounting was something I was both interested in and did well in.</p>
                        <p>These discoveries led to be deciding that BYU, with its incredible business schools, would make a great choice for me. I worked hard and was admitted to BYU in Fall 2021. Since then I have been working on taking classes for the Accounting major. I apply soon to the program and hope to get accepted and then begin to prepare for the master's program.</p>
